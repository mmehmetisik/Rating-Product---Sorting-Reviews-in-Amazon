# Business Problem
- One of the most important problems in e-commerce is the correct calculation of the points given to the products after the sale. 
- The solution to this problem means more customer satisfaction for the e-commerce site, product prominence for sellers and a smooth shopping experience for buyers.
-  Another problem is the correct ranking of the reviews given to the products. 
-  Since the prominence of misleading reviews will directly affect the sales of the product, it will cause both financial loss and customer loss. 
-  In solving these 2 basic problems, e-commerce sites and sellers will increase their sales while customers will complete their purchasing journey smoothly.
